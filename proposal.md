# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Tarono Adventure

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

The project will be a remake of a pre-existing game made on pygame. This remake will have its own story to stand out from the original creation.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

As of right now, we want the game to run similarly to that of a Pok√©mon game(Teams, turn-based combat, creature catching, etc.). All of its features will follow the same theme as well.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

NA

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, almost everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Our good outcome would be to have the base gameplay accomplished.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The better outcome would be the base gameplay would also have its new story with it.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We hope that along with the base game with an original story, we also come up with original assets like sprites. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

One major skill my partner and I will need to learn is how to utilize pygame, as neither one of us has used it before. Over the next couple of weeks, we will try to gain a better understanding of both python and pygame. So far we haven't divided the work between us both.
